# Diffing Tool

Diffing tools show you what changed between two versions of a file.
You probably know this from code review tools, e.g. the one from GitHub.
I decided to implement my own diffing tool for fun. :)

## Usage

To show the diff between `file1` and `file2`:

```sh
$ python3 diff.py file1.txt file2.txt
```

There are several optional flags.
